Compatibility: 1.1.x and 2.0

This modification changes the random news box.

Instead of: 
News: Your Site News Here

It shows:
[center][size=2][b]Your Site News Here[/b][/size][/center]

This mod removes the [b]News:[/b] title from the section, and it also centers, enlarges, and bolds the text for the news you enter through the Admin panel. This saves you from doing the center, size, and bold bbc tags.
