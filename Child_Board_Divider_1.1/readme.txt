This mod fixes the missing divider between child boards in the parent board's index.
When go into a board that has child boards, the list of the child boards above the topic list,
does not have dividers like the main board index does. Even here at SMF site they don't. 

Like here for example: [iurl=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?board=20.0]Converting to SMF[/iurl]
Notice compared to main board index, there are no dividing lines between the different child boards.

I had posted this as support issue, and ARG found the fix:
