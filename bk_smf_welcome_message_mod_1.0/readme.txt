This modification changes the welcome message to guests and members.

Instead of: Hello [b]Member's Name[/b] or Welcome, [b]Guest[/b]
It shows: Hello [b]Member's Name[/b], Welcome back to [Your Site Name Here] or Hello [b]Guest[/b], Welcome to [Your Site Name Here]

It also enlarges the text for the time and date, and bolds the text for both.
