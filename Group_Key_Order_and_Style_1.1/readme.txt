This mod will allow changing the order of the membergroups legend under the list of online members.

The displayed member legend by default is:
    [Administrator] [Global Moderator] [Hero Member] [Sr. Member] [Full Member] [Jr. Member] [Newbie]

Re-arrange the display of groups the way you would like it displayed by going to:
    Admin -> Modification Settings ->Miscellaneous

Remove or add group id's from the list to select the groups you want to be displayed.
Separate the arranged group id with comma except for the the last number (i.e. 1,2,8,7,6,5,4).

After any changes, you will need to clear your forum cache:
Admin » Forum Maintenance » Routine
Click Run Task Now for Empty the file cache
